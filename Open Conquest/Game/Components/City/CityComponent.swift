            this assumes that ALL cities in the world are being received
         
            TOOO in the future... in a different method and api endpoint??
            maybe not different endpoint but need to enable queries.. to figure
            out at a later date, but don't forget about it! so here ya go now you
            won't forget because this comment should really stick out.
